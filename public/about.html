<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Vladyslava, and at the moment I am a student at
  the Kyiv Polytechnic University, where I study software engineering.
  My journey in the world of development began here, and I feel a great
  responsibility and interest in this field.
</p>

<p>
  My achievement at the moment is the role of junior .Net developer.
  My university gave me valuable experience in software development,
  working with C# and .Net technologies, and taught me to work 
  effectively in a team. I am always looking to expand my skills 
  and approach work with great attention to detail.

<p>
  Now I am actively working on becoming a full-stack web developer. 
  I take relevant courses and practical tasks to master the front-end
  and back-end of web development. My goal is to create modern and 
  effective web applications that will satisfy the needs of users 
  and make a significant effort in the field of Internet technologies.

  I have a strong interest in innovation and continuous learning, 
  and I am ready to bring my knowledge and enthusiasm to your team.
  I believe that my motivation and desire to achieve great results 
  will be important assets for your company.
